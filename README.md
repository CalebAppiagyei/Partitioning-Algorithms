# Partitioning_Algorithms

This program contains two seperate algorithms that will split a given list of positive integers in two different ways. 
One of the algorithms will find the total number of integers in the file and will create two new text files. One containing
the first half of the integers and the second containing the last half. The second algorithm also creates two new text files
however, it instead splits the integers by every other number. One file from this second algorithm will contain every integer
at each odd index and the other file will contain each integer at every even index.
